# actix-web-sqlite-template

This is s small template for a web microservice using rust - actix-web and pure sqlite.

It ilustrate the common route and handler and request data extraction that actix support.

Just copy the whole dir into the target prject and start adding more handlers, and enjoy.

I might add a branch later to use `diesel`.
